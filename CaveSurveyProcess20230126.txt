for Collect Survey Data:
    if Sketch = "Digital":
        Instrument = "Disto X2" OR Instrument = "BRIC4"
        #Disto X2 is preferred
        if Book = "Lenovo Tab 410":
            Comfortable passage will be surveyed
            10 inch Android tablet
        elif Book = "Motorola G Pure":
            Smaller device needed
            6.5 inch Android phone
        if Application = "TopoDroid":
            Export Data Format = Therion #.th
            Export Sketch Format = DXF #.dxf
        elif Application = "Qave"
            Export Data Format = Therion #.th
            Export Sketch Format = SVG #.svg
        elif Application = "SextTopo":
            #less familiar with process
            Export Data Format = Therion #.th
            Export Sketch Format = SVG #.svg
    elif Sketch = "Paper"
        Instrument = "Disto X2" OR Instrument = "BRIC4"
        #Disto X2 is preferred
        Book = "Rite in the Rain"
        if Paper = "Standard":
            Survey normal conditions
        elif Paper = "DuraRite":
            Very wet conditions expected
for Process Data:
    if Sketch = "Digital":
        open Therion
            convert survey data to shapefiles #.shp
        run Python script in ArcGIS Pro
            linepolot files are generated
        if Application = "Qave" OR Application = "SexyTopo":
            open Inkscape
                convert SVG to DXF
    elif Sketch = "Paper":
        open Excel
            add survey data to excel and run macros
        run Python script in ArcGIS Pro
            linepolot files are generated
for Map Production:
    open ArcGIS Pro OR QGIS
        add lineplot data
        georeference sketches
        use template data to digitize features
        generate layout
        export final map
